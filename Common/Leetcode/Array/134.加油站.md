134.Gas Station

## 问题

There are *N* gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station *i* is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station *i* to its next station (*i*+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**

- If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
- Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
- Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1

Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

## 题解

1.添加条件

1. 如果没有一个点的加油量大于减少量退出
2. 如果加油总量小于耗油量退出
3. 根据条件1，查找到开始点，然后将每一次的开始点进行测试

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        boolean b1= false,b2=false;
        int[] count = new int[gas.length];
        int sum=0;
        int j =0;
        int length = cost.length;
        int gassum=0,costsum=0;
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            gassum+=gas[i];
            costsum+=cost[i];
            if(gas[i]>=cost[i]){
                count[j++]=i;
                b1 = true;
            }
        }
        if(gassum>=costsum){
            b2 =true;
        }
        if(!b1&&!b2){
            return -1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
            int temp = count[i];
            sum = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < cost.length; k++) {
                sum+=gas[(k+temp)%length];
                sum-=cost[(k+temp)%length];
                if(sum<0){
                    break;
                }
                if(k==length-1){
                    return count[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

2.尽管开始点不一样但是每个点的损失与加油是不变的

> The basic idea is every time we start from a station, we go as far as possible by increasing `end` until remaining gas is less than 0. If 'end' finally hits `start` we know we can travel around from 'start'. If we haven't traveled around, we know we cannot start from this station. Then we check the station before our start station if we can start from this station. Repeat until we have checked all stations.
>
> Note there is a little trick that every time we try to find the next start station, we always to back to extend the distance from start to end so that we can check all stations on the circuit. Otherwise, if we move start forward to decrease the distance from start to end, we are likely to end up with only checking part of the circuit. Another trick is we start from the end of the array so as to avoid some corner cases.

<p>基本思想是，每次我们从某个站点开始时，我们都会通过增加结束点来尽可能地走，直到剩余气体少于0。如果“结束点”最终命中开始，我们知道我们可以从“开始点”开始走动。 如果我们没有四处走走，我们知道我们不能从这个车站开始。 然后，我们可以在起始站之前检查该站，是否可以从该站开始。 重复直到检查完所有电台。</p>

<p>请注意，有一个小技巧，每次尝试查找下一个起始站时，我们总是要回头以延长从起点到终点的距离，以便我们可以检查电路上的所有站。 否则，如果我们向前移动起点以减小起点到终点的距离，则很可能最终仅检查部分电路。 另一个技巧是我们从数组的末尾开始，以避免出现一些极端情况。</p>

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int start = gas.length-1;
        int end = 0;
        int sum = gas[start]-cost[start];
        while (start>end){
            if (sum>=0){
                sum+=gas[end]-cost[end];
                ++end;
            }else {
                --start;
                sum+=gas[start]-cost[start];
            }
        }
        return sum>=0?start:-1;
    }
}
```

这有个错误案例
