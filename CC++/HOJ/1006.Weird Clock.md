## 1006 - Weird Clock

### Problem Description

A weird clock marked from 0 to 59 has only a minute hand. It won't move until a special coin is thrown into its box. There are different kinds of coins as your options. However once you make your choice, you cannot use any other kind. There are infinite number of coins of each kind, each marked with a number d ( 0 <= 1000 ), meaning that this coin will make the minute hand move d times clockwise the current time. For example, if the current time is 45, and d = 2. Then the minute hand will move clockwise 90 minutes and will be pointing to 15.

Now you are given the initial time s ( 0 <= s <= 59 ) and the coin's type d. Write a program to find the minimum number of d-coins needed to turn the minute hand back to 0.

### Input

There are several tests. Each test occupies a line containing two positive integers s and d.

The input is finished by a line containing 0 0.

### Output

For each test print in a single line the minimum number of coins needed. If it is impossible to turn the hand back to 0, output "Impossible".

### Sample Input

```
30 1
0 0
```

### Sample Output

```
1
```

        while(s!=0){
            temp = (temp+(d*s))%60;
            if(s==temp){
                cout << "Impossible" << endl;
                break;
            }

## 1009 - Fat Cat(unsolved)

### Problem Description

Fat cat's duty is to catch mice, and it controls several rooms arranged in a matrix in which mice often come. Now a mouse comes into this room matrix and digs many many holes, and the mouse is cunning and it knows that fat cat will sleep in the daytime, so it goes out for food in that time instead of at night. Fat cat has to put some cheese in each room to make it out.

The mouse always appears first at room(0,0), and it will turn to another room near the current room which has the most number of cheese after it eats up the cheese in the room. If there is no adjacent room or the number of cheese is 0 in every adjacent room, the mouse quickly run in a hole after it eats the cheese and fat cat can't catch it.

When the mouse and the cat arrive at the same room or the mouse turns to a room where the cat is at the same time, the cat can catch the mouse!

When the mouse first appears, fat cat is in room(i,j)(not in room(0,0)),and it wants to catch the mouse as quickly as it can before the mouse runs away. We suppose that both the cat and the mouse move only vertically or horizontally 1 step in each time period.

Now it's your turn to write a program to calculate how many steps at least fat cat should move to catch the mouse. For example: the mouse starts at room(0,0), and fat cat is in room(2,0) at the same time. And the mouse moves to room(0,1),while fat cat can go to either room(2,1) or room(1,0), or just stay there.

### Input

the input contains mutiple cases. The first line of each case consists of two positive integer: n and m (1&ltn&lt=100,1&ltm&lt=100),showing that the room matrix has n rows and m columns rooms. Then will be n rows non_negative integers presenting the number of cheese in each room(there are no two rooms have the same positive number of cheese). Each row has m integers. The following row shows fat cat's initial position: row i and column j.

### Output

for each case,print the minimum number of time period fat cat uses to catch the mouse in a single line. If the mouse run away before being caught, print "impossible" instead.

### Sample Input

2 2
15 3
2 4
0 1
3 3
1 5 9
3 7 0
2 4 6

### Sample Output

## 1025- Skew Binary(unsolved)

### Problem Description

It had been a year since Swamp County Computing established a functional programming group. Your (non-functional programming) group is going to throw a surprise party for the anniversary. Now the functional folks really like skew binary numbers for some reason. "Easy to increment and decrement!" they say. Your task is to write a program to convert decimal integers to skew binary in the format they like. This will help in making banners and other party material.

Number representations are made up of a list of digits. Call the lowest order digit the rank 0 digit, the next, rank 1, etc. For example, in decimal representation, digits are 0-9, the rank 0 digit has weight 1, the rank 1 digit has weight 10, and the rank i digit has weight 10i. In binary representation, the digits are 0 and 1, and the rank i digit has weight 2i. In skew binary representation, the digits are 0, 1, and 2, and the rank i digit has weight 2^(i+1)-1.

```
						Rank	Weight	
						0	1	
						1	3	
						2	7	
						3	15		
						4	31	
						5	63	
						6	127	
						7	255	
						. :	. :	
```

Allowing the digit 2 in the skew binary means there may be several ways to represent a given number. However the convention is that the digit 2 may only appear as the lowest rank non-zero digit. This makes the representation unique.

In this problem, you should use a special way to write skew binary numbers as a list of ranks of non-zero digits in the number. The digit 2 is represented by the rank of the digit appearing twice in the list. Note that this means that only the first two ranks in the list may be equal.

Each rank is a decimal integer, and is separated from the next rank by a comma (','). A list is started by a '[' and ended by a ']'. For example, the decimal number 5, which has the skew representation 12, should be written as [0,0,1]. Decimal 0 is an empty list: [].

### Input

The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10), the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing a single decimal number with no leading or trailing white space. Each number will be in the range 0...100663270 (inclusive).

### Output

There should be one line per test case containing the input decimal number, with no leading zeros or spaces, a single space, and the skew binary equivalent in list format with no leading or trailing spaces. Within the list each rank should have no extra leading zeros or leading or trailing spaces.

### Sample Input

```
5
0
1
2
3
4
```

### Sample Output

```
0 []
1 [0]
2 [0,0]
3 [1]
4 [0,1]
```





## 1043 - Maya Calendar(unsolved)

### Problem Description

During his last sabbatical, professor M. A. Ya made a surprising discovery about the old Maya calendar. From an old knotted message, professor discovered that the Maya civilization used a 365 day long year, called *Haab*, which had 19 months. Each of the first 18 months was 20 days long, and the names of the months were *pop, no, zip, zotz, tzec, xul, yoxkin, mol, chen, yax, zac, ceh, mac, kankin, muan, pax, koyab, cumhu*. Instead of having names, the days of the months were denoted by numbers starting from 0 to 19. The last month of Haab was called *uayet* and had 5 days denoted by numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The Maya believed that this month was unlucky, the court of justice was not in session, the trade stopped, people did not even sweep the floor.

For religious purposes, the Maya used another calendar in which the year was called *Tzolkin* (holly year). The year was divided into thirteen periods, each 20 days long. Each day was denoted by a pair consisting of a number and the name of the day. They used 20 names: *imix, ik, akbal, kan, chicchan, cimi, manik, lamat, muluk, ok, chuen, eb, ben, ix, mem, cib, caban, eznab, canac, ahau* and 13 numbers; both in cycles.

Notice that each day has an unambiguous description. For example, at the beginning of the year the days were described as follows:

*1 imix, 2 ik, 3 akbal, 4 kan, 5 chicchan, 6 cimi, 7 manik, 8 lamat, 9 muluk, 10 ok, 11 chuen, 12 eb, 13 ben, 1 ix, 2 mem, 3 cib, 4 caban, 5 eznab, 6 canac, 7 ahau, and again in the next period 8 imix, 9 ik, 10 akbal . . .*

Years (both Haab and Tzolkin) were denoted by numbers 0, 1, : : : , where the number 0 was the beginning of the world. Thus, the first day was:

Haab: 0. pop 0

### Input

The date in Haab is given in the following format:

*NumberOfTheDay. Month Year*

The first line of the input file contains the number of the input dates in the file. The next n lines contain n dates in the Haab calendar format, each in separate line. The year is smaller then 5000.

### Output

The date in Tzolkin should be in the following format:

Number NameOfTheDay Year

The first line of the output file contains the number of the output dates. In the next n lines, there are dates in the Tzolkin calendar format, in the order corresponding to the input dates.

### Sample Input

```
3
10. zac 0
0. pop 0
10. zac 1995
```

### Sample Output

```
3
3 chuen 0
1 imix 0
9 cimi 2801
```
